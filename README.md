## Random Sequential Adsorption - Algorithms and implementation

A number of problems in chemistry, biology, and physics concern processes
occurring sequentially and essentially irreversible. Random adsorption model 
Sequential Packing (RSA) is a random packing model that has attracted a lot 
of attention due to its many applications in this type of problem.

## Installation

Run the following to install:

> pip -m install git+https://github.com/WTrzupek/Random-Sequential-AdsorptionSA#egg=Random-Sequential-Adsorption

## Usage

1. Import the following:

>>> import RSA.naive as naive
>>> import RSA.improved as improved
>>> import RSA.precise as precise
>>> import RSA.GUI as gui

2. Call the function as below:

>>> gui.call()

3. In "Wysycenie" and "Wielkość" fields enter the value as showed
